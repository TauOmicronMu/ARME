The Sensory Motor Neuroscience Centre performs interdisciplinary research into the sensory and motor systems of the human brain. Research takes place in both naturalistic and constrained settings, with synthesized environments (virtual reality) to examine the roles of different sensory cues in integrated perception and action. As many everyday tasks require cooperative actions between people, the lab studies interpersonal collaboration in tasks including handing over objects between people, walking and talking together in a corridor and playing in a musical ensemble.
