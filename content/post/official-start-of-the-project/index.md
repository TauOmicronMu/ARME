We are excited that on September 1st the project has officially started! 

So many things to do now. We are in the planning phase of the first set of recordings. We will have multiple days of recordings with the [Coull Quartet](https://www.coullquartet.com) (see also their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Coull-Quartet/100063018892350/)) by our scientists together with our industry partners [PartPlay](https://partplay.co.uk) and [SemanticAudio](http://www.semanticaudio.co.uk).
